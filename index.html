<div class="sectionheading"> 12. A task-runner is used to define different tasks, define how they are called, in which order they are executed and what dependencies they have. Provides 2 examples of task runner. </div>

<button class="collapsible"> How are they called... </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    A task runner is typically called using a command line interface (CLI), where developers can execute various commands to perform different tasks. The specific commands and syntax may vary depending on the task runner being used.
  </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible"> Order </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    Task runners execute tasks in the order specified in the configuration file or build script. Each task may have dependencies on other tasks, which are defined in the configuration file, and the task runner will ensure that the dependent tasks are executed before the task that depends on them.
  </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible"> Dependencies </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    Task runners may have dependencies on other software tools, packages, or libraries that are required to perform their tasks. For example, a task runner may depend on a specific version of a programming language, a build tool, a package manager, or other tools required to build or deploy an application.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to these external dependencies, task runners may also have internal dependencies between the tasks defined in their configuration file or build script. For example, a task to compile source code may depend on a task to lint the code first, or a task to run tests may depend on a task to build the code first.
  </p>

<div class="sectionheading"> 23. Asynchronous await vs. synchronous blocking calls vs. noblocking calls </div>

<button class="collapsible"> Asynchronous await </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    Using callbacks, you pass a function as an argument to another function, and that function calls your function when it's done. With promises, you create an object that represents a future value, and you can attach callbacks to that object to handle success or failure. With async/await syntax, you can write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code.
  </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible"> Synchronous </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    When you make a synchronous function call, the program waits for the function to complete before moving on to the next line of code. This can lead to performance issues and can make applications feel unresponsive.
  </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible"> Blocking calls </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    Those that cause the program to wait until the operation is complete before moving on to the next line of code. This can lead to performance issues, especially if the operation takes a long time to complete.
  </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible"> Non-blocking calls </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    They do not cause the program to wait. Instead, they return immediately, and the program can continue executing other code while the operation is being performed. This can lead to better performance and a more responsive application.
  </p>
</div>

  </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible"> AJAX </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    An older method of making asynchronous HTTP requests. It uses the XMLHttpRequest object to send the request and handle the response.
  </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible"> Promise </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    A built-in JavaScript object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and allows you to handle it using a chain of then() and catch() methods.
  </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible"> Callback function </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    A function that is passed as an argument to another function and is called back later when the operation is complete. Callback functions are commonly used in asynchronous programming to handle the response of an operation.
  </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible"> Asynchronous function </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    Functions that return Promises and allow you to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous. They use the "async" keyword to mark the function as asynchronous and the "await" keyword to wait for the completion of asynchronous operations.
  </p>
</div>

  </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible"> Express middleware </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    A function that sits between the request and response objects, and can be used to perform a variety of tasks, such as parsing request bodies, logging requests, and handling errors. Middleware functions can be used globally, for all requests, or can be defined for specific routes. They are executed in order, and can modify the request or response objects as needed before passing them on to the next middleware function in the chain.
